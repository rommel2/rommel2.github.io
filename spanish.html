  <p> Spanish I could say is one of my more harder subject because it's an entire other subject and having Del Rio you have to learn how to be independent because many people are going to need help. I learned that you either have to be ahead of the game or wait in line and lose the game.Even though her class is hard the projects she come up with really does brighten my day.</p> 
<h2>Day Of The Dead</h2>

<p>This was the first project I could say that I really enjoyed myself. This project was my favorite because she allowed us to do something devoted to any one. And Paul Walker was one of the best actors I knew , and to have a way to honor him even though I couldn't physically give him this it felt like I honored his death.</p>
