                    <p> My Thoughts</p>

<hr>

<p>In People Live in Silence I created a painting,that is an interpretation of soundwaves based from an audio recording of my voice saying the statement.People live in silence I chose this statement because Every day people  have great ideas but yet never speak up. People are talked down to and never speak up or defend themselves. Sometimes people forget that those people who are considered higher ups or ( more important ) are the same as them, A human being.</p>
<p>And if i notice it then i'm pretty sure they do This statement is powerful because It speaks up and let so many people know that everyone is created equal but crafted into something minor. So many people let themselves be simplified when everyone has potential to be so much more ,and that brings us back to People live in silence. To me people only are put in groups if allowed too , However for the people who determined how they wanted to live they can say that they are in control over there lifes.</p>
<p>Color adds to the overall meaning of the work by using colors that could easily be understood and help anyone understand my piece even more These colors add to the overall meaning of the statement by The colors black and white are well suited colors because these colors are on a piano. And to me a piano is a very powerful instrument but silent also. The piano itself is soft  , gentle but can easily be powerful if given a “chance” to be.  </p>
<p>And also the black background looks as if it is conquering the white , as in the white is the people's voice and black is the system that doesn't allow it to be heard._And lastly because these colors contrast so much when you think about it so is silence in people because every can be heard but don’t choose to or can’t be. For example there has been many times when I can say i've had so ideas that were so good i couldn't even think of them twice. And instead of me speaking up I just satb there and let it fade away.</p>
