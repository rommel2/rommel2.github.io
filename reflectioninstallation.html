                 <h3>Reflection on installation project</h3>

                <p>I liked  this project because of all the freedom we were  through the project . gave us complete control on what we  videos to sculptures to drawing.The purpose of our project was what our teenage experience is like  . We did t well by using emojis which mainly everyone uses to show Emotion not with words but the drawing itself.(Creativity) And over all i think we did an honest good job on how we went about it all.

I basically did all of the paperwork. note taking i did good  label everything and was very descriptive on what needed to be done , what was being done and who did what. For half of the project then i was on cleanup duty.  the artist statement. I figured out how to make a QR code to connect with our video, for a video version of the artist statement.  And on exhibition day i did security and and was in charge of who be let in when to close off the door so that no one could interrupt the presentation with leaving and entering the set.

  freedom  From how to go about it , what materials we need to have , the jobs we were giving ,even where we wanted to set up our project as well. i would keep everything the same because overall it came together as one big success. The only thing i would improve on is any way to keep paint off the floor lol. but i have no cold feed back i love the project all together. 

And the reason was because  choose what we wanted our project to be . And since it was something we wanted to do we had no problem working on it and going above and beyond. And that doesn’t even just go for our project either. students went all out honestly. from the wing project , to the scary group. Then during the “big day” When it all came together it was something i was glad to be apart off. And those words are courtesy of Mr.Morris. 

What i learned  that people are more creative than i thought. And also it doesn’t matter who you're in a group with as long as it's a topic you all agree on it's gonna come out better than you would think it will. And more importantly i learned that Ms. dudik project will go down in my book for one of the projects i love this year. (kissing up to the teacher :))
