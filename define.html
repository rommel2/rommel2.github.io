                    <p> Dads Words Ignite Fire</p>
                    <p>Honestly this project made me dig deep to me because I never had shared this moment with anyone, And at the same token this project was self preserveation.
                  I feel that this made realize more about myself than any intervention. The way entire way this project just made me realize how lucky I  am to have a father like mines.  </p>

<p>Everyone has those days that shape them , well mine is when my dad sat me down in his room and told me how much he was proud to be my father.And to a young boy like me that's all I liked to hear . This was a powerful compliment to me because no one has ever made me feel as special as he did that day. Then, I never realized that he actually noticed me because he was always at work. And like I said before, nothing comes close to this moment.</p>
<p>This was powerful and was good enough for me to share because  I can say no one has ever been that real with me before.  And for him just to come out of the blue and give me such a thoughtful statement like that , it's just extraordinary to have the bravery to say that yet alone think it . He said that I never made him worry or disappointed him before. Then he took a deep breath and said my presence alone made him feel accomplished as a father. With my name he knew there was always something good and astonishing coming right after. And after that it really just made me feel like I was worth something to someone and around that time I needed that because I lost a lot of family members , and I felt most also.
</p>
<p>But the real reason I was so surprised was because I never thought he noticed anything I did or accomplished because he was always at work and we barely saw each other , so of course I would think he didn't care enough because this has never happened before.And when he said he might not be there but he kept tabs on me with my teachers I knew that he cared about me. And my smile just got so wide that even the sky couldn't match how infinite it was. It was as bright as the Sun’s Rays early in the morning. His voice began to crack because he's an emotional person because that's what he was taught , to show his feelings toward family, so he opened his arms and he squeezed me so hard , it was as if I was being juiced but it didn't hurt.
</p>
<p>To me nothing comes close to this moment because I can tell it came from the heart. That day I concluded how he really felt about me and I had no idea that cared as much as he did. but the last comment he made, that just made me cry was ,” I was gonna be a great dad and that  my child would be lucky to have a dad like me. “ I couldn't say nothing but thank you to him.
</p>
<p>This is the moment that made me realize that I was meant to be something in life. And nothing comes close to it whatsoever. And the moral of the story is nothing is stronger than a father son  relationship/connection. From that day forward all I could feel was love , all I could think about was that moment in time . But the funny thing was that's all I wanted to think about at the same time.

</p>
<p>Even at this age looking back on it , there still isn't anything else that comes before that . And to me that's just crazy because nothing is supposed to last that long and still have the same gut feeling it used to . Not even the death of family members keep me depressed , this actually is the reason that keeps me from getting depressed because as long as I have him I feel like that's all I need in order to succeed because he's also my best friend and that's all u need in life. Well that's all I need in life.
